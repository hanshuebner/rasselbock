![rasselbock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanshuebner/rasselbock/master/public/rasselbock.jpg)

rasselbock is a web server written in VAX LISP.  I wrote it for fun,
to learn how to program in VAX LISP and in particular how to interface
with VMS system services and the Record Management Services (RMS).
Please don't expect this to be too useful.

# Prerequisites

 * OpenVMS V5.5-2 on VAX
 * VAX LISP V3.1
 * TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS (UCX) V4.2
